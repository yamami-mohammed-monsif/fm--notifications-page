## Description

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a Notifications page. The page displays a list of notifications, each with information about the sender, type of notification, and time. Users can mark all notifications as read with the "Mark all as read" button, which updates the notifications count to zero and removes any unread indicators. Clicking on an individual notification removes its unread indicator and decrements the notifications count by one. Additionally, there's functionality to toggle the display of private messages when clicked.

## Features

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## Technologies Used

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
